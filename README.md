# Football-Analytics-with-R
## Introduction   

This project was created as a part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project - Case Study 3. Since this is not an existing case study - I have created this case study as an exercise to be done with some real datasets of Premier League footballers and teams in the season 2017/2018.  A short summary of what this project will attempt to do is to let the stakeholders know the top 10 and the bottom 10 players in their positions in the Premier league season of 2017/18.
